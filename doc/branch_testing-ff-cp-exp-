On branch testing-ff-cp-exp-

  * config/peripheral_clk_config.h

This is a copy of Adafruit CircuitPython's variant on this
important file (well, one of them anyway). The file has the
markings to say just where it's from.

Works - produces the Hello World message, so it's provisionally
good and it bumps CPU freq to 120 MHz in the bargain.

Hopefully compatible with any code found in CircuitPython that
furthers the goal of a working UART (SERCOM5) RX pin (to gain
keystrokes from the outside world, which is the primary focus
of this investigation).
